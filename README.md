If you'd like to see some examples of the interesting custom SQL I have written to get my data formatted properly in Tableau, you can do that [here](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Nested-Sets-SQL-to-Tableau-Project). If you're more interested in the Python scripts that I have written to clean, generate, and document data at my job, you can find that [here](https://github.com/AnniesAnalytics/Python-codes). 

If you'd like to leave GitHub and check out my Tableau skills, you can do so [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anniesanalytics).

My YouTube is a good place to get to know my story, and those of a growing number of other data analysts and analytics managers + some guided Tableau projects. Find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTK2T4XOowq4eA0EsfpdIw).
